## Introduction

NetherwingCore is a MMORPG Framework based mostly in Java.

This project is derived from TrinityCore, building upon its code. It adapts the logic originally implemented in C++ to Java.

**NetherwingCore** was created with the goal of implementing a **server/framework** for **World of Warcraft (build 7.3.5.26972)**, using the conceptual foundation and game rules established in TrinityCore as a reference. The aim is not simply to port code, but to **reinterpret and reconstruct the logic** within the Java ecosystem, seeking a balance between **behavioral fidelity** and a **clearer, more modular, and sustainable architecture**.

Version **7.3.5.26972** is the starting point for development, intended to provide a solid and evolving foundation for essential server systems (e.g., network infrastructure, authentication, entity management, combat rules, scripts, and support services). As the core matures and becomes viable, the project can be expanded to **other versions of the game**, maintaining the same philosophy: logical compatibility, organization, and incremental evolution.

In short, NetherwingCore is a Java-based framework inspired by TrinityCore, designed to serve as a **development and experimentation platform** for the community, focusing on **maintainability**, **extensibility**, and **consistency** with the expected mechanics of World of Warcraft in the target build.
